## 1. Proyect Motivation

  Project_1 is the first project of the data cience Udacity Course. The idea is to analize a dataset, find interesting questions about the data and solve
  those questions with tools learned during the course.


## 2. File Description

  The file begins with the import of necessary libraries and a brief look into the dataset. Later, each one of the questions is raised and then answers with 
  linear regression models and descriptive statistics.
  
  Question 1: Not having any type of formal education affects a person's job satisfaction and salary?
  Question 2: How does hours worked and salary affect a person's job satisfaction?
  Question 3: People that live in the US, UK and Colombia earn a diferent salaries even when we control by gender and by hours worked?


## 3. Interaction with the Proyect

  Interaction with the proyect is simple. Running the libraries and uploading the datasets is necessary before starting to answer the three questions. Then each
  question has a section of code wich can be run seperatly.
